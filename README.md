# Introduction

ðŸ‘¦ Hi, I'm Rigel Ma, a college student. Welcome to my repository!! 

ðŸ’» I'm interested in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning. Also I've been working on algorithms for a while.

ðŸŽˆ If you are fond of engaging big data competition, maybe we can have a nice try to do it!!
